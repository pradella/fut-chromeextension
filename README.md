## Disclaimer

This project was intended to create automations with WebApp due the lack of functionalities in the original version, and also for learning purposes (myself). I don't have enough data to prove this method is 100% free of ban risk. Before go ahead, make sure you're using a FUT account that you don't mind if you loose it.
